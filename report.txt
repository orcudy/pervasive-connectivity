Demographics
The first principle component primary consists of whether someone is married, has children, and is currently employed. The second principle component primarily consists of how long someone has been living at their current residence and their income. Their is clearly a linear relationship between the two principle components; however, as all the classes overlay one another, I am unable to classify based on the demographics category.

Phone Information
Many of the questions in the phone information category were dependent on answers to previous questions and was therefore very sparse. As is ilustrated by the principle components, computation of the eigenvectors was unsuccessful as many features resolved to "nan". Phone information does not provide good information for analysis as the data was too sparse and should not be considered further.

Perceived Control of Life
The first principle component primarily consists of how upset someone has been, how nervous and stressed someone has been, how someone has found that they could not cope with all the things they had to do, and how they found difficulties were piling up so high that they could not overcome them. The second principle component primarily consists of how someone felt confident about their ability to handle any personal problem, and been able to control irritations in their life. Intuitively, these principle components seem orthgonal: The first is a measure of how negative someone feels and the second is a measure of how positive someone feels. The data in the perceived control of life category does not separate and I am unable to classify in any meaningful way.

Internet Usage
The first and second principle components are both primarily consist of how often someone uses Pinterest and how many emails are sent or received on an average day. It seems odd that both the first and second principle components are primarily comprised of the same feature because the two components must be orthogonal. Despite this curiousity, the data does not diverge in any meaningful way and cannot be used for classification.

Social Association
The first principle component primarily consists of whether the respondent knows someone who has just started a new job and whether they know someone who has just moved or changed homes. The second principle component consists of whether the respondent knows someone who has just been fired or layed off, whether they know someone who experienced a demotion or pay cut at work, whether they know somene who become engaged or married, and whether they know someone who has given birth, became pregnant, or adopted a child. There is not a clear orthogonal interpretation of the principle components. Also, as the data did not separate, the social association category cannot be used for classification.

Government
The first principle component primarily consists of whether someone would be willing to discuss government surveillance programs at a community meeting, at work, or at a restaurant with friends. The second principle component primarily consists of whether someone's family members, close friends, neighbors, and Facebook friends agree with them about their views on government surveillance programs. There is no clear orthogonal relationship between the principle components. Additionally, because the data did not separate, the government category cannot be used for classification.

Fear of Exclusion
The first principle component primarily consists of whether someone feels that one of the worst things that can happen to them is to be excluded by people they know. They second principle component primarily consists of whether someone feels it is important for them to fit into the group they are with. There is no clear orthogonal relationship between the principle components and, because the data did not separate, the fear of exclusion category cannot be used for classification.
